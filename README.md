# echo

Python meta-circular evaluator. Inspired by the approach taken by
[Narcissus](https://github.com/mozilla/narcissus).

## Potential

By performing guest-interpreter evaluation via the host interpreter, we can:

* Remain fully compatible to CPython (e.g. extension
  capabilities), while
* Virtualize the language (e.g. for analysis/intercepting
  of control flow), and
* Potentially making the guest-language extensible in future
  work.

## Usage

The `echo.py` command line utility attempts to act like a substitute Python
driver that uses the guest interpreter instead of the host interpreter; e.g.

```
python3 echo.py /tmp/my_test.py
```

Ideally would match the results of direct invocation via the standard (host)
interpreter:

```
python3 /tmp/my_test.py
```

This is the property that echo attempts to build towards.

### Approach

Echo currently interprets host-Python (CPython) generated bytecodes, and thus
may be sensitive to variations in bytecodes between Python versions. The
versions actively being tested are reflected in the `.travis.yml` file.

## Testing

py.test is driven via a configuration file in the root of the project
directory; so a developer can simply run:

```
py.test-3
```

To run particular tests with the logging level raised:

```
py.test-3 -k kwarg --log-cli-level=DEBUG
```

### Type checking

Type annotations are used where appropriate and checked via the "pytype"
command line utility:

```
pytype --config=pytype.cfg 
```
